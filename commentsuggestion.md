In case someone else has that weird graphic bug, where sometimes a line is shown above the slime: it can be fixed by going to Project settings > Rendering > 2D and enabling "Snap 2D Transforms to Pixel".
alternatively, play around with the sprite sheet settings of the animated slime sprite to add some vertical offset
